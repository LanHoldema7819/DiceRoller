# DiceRoller
A user friendy and eassy way to roll dice.
We built this program for anyone who needs dice but doesn't have the time or money to get dice.
To run this program you need Code Runner or Eclipse or a program that allows you to run and edit java code.
The contributers were Kaede Cunningham and my self.
